# Php Data Structures And Algorithms

## About
A repository of data structures such as Queues, Stacks, Trees and Algorithms such as Binary Search, Merge Sort and Quick Sort written in PHP.

## Motivation 
I hope this repository acts as a helpful reference for learning data structures and algorithms in PHP. I know that there is a lot more to add and all and any
feedback to optimise these implementations would be extremely helpful! 

## Current List 

* Data Structures 
  * Linked List
  * Stack 
  * Queue
  * Trees
  * Graphs 
  
* Algorithms 
  * Binary Search 
  * Bubble sort 
  * Merge sort 
  * Quick sort

## Status
This will be a constant work in progress and as I learn more, I hope to add to this repository, building up this collection bit by bit.
